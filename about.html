        <p>Exeter based artist originally trained as an oil painter in university the more traditional still life work I
          was doing began to feel stale and after moving to Bristol around 7 years ago I started experimenting with
          spray paint. Initially I started out working with very simple stencils but diving into the complicated process
          of cutting tiny holes in paper grabbed my attention and focus like nothing previously.
          For a long time my work had been concerned with elements of pattern within the stencils painting images of
          birds because of the way they lent themselves to this. Over the last year and half however I have moved back
          to a city scenes a subject that I worked with a lot in my oil paintings. My main concern with these works is
          looking at the city I now call home trying to find some of the beauty that I feel like people overlook. As
          well as this I am exploring the blending of detailed stencil work to highlight the focal points of the piece
          as well as large loose acrylic painting bringing a semi abstract quality to areas of the images.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have recently moved to exeter and due to home circumstances I'm temporarily not working with spray paint
          this change is going to lead to some more traditional work that in tandem with the wonderful countryside on my
          doorstep so look out for that.</p>
